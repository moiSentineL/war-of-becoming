# My Physical Notetaking System
## About
I tend to prioritise portability and modularity when it comes to physical note-taking. I wouldn't want 5 separate notebooks for every subject just so I can note something down that won't even stick to my mind for a long time.

In my opinion, the notes you take from school is a mere memory jogger for when you actually learn the shit better.

Here's my Workflow:
## Setup
### Things needed
- A5 Refillable Binder - main unit which holds everything down
	- Folded A4 printed templates
- Section Dividers (3-4 based on no. of subs)
- Rough Pad for all the rough work
- 2 Pens - one black and one blue.
## How it works
>[!tldr] 
>Your main objective is to curate information that you actually need at school. Your Obsidian workflow will handle the rest.
### Rough Pad
**Use when:**
- You're solving something _for the first time_
- You’re unsure, experimenting, or flailing a little
- It’s fast, dirty, or doesn't need to be remembered
- You're warming up before a real problem set

> “If you’re bleeding ink and don’t know what the fuck is happening — it’s rough.”
### Capture Sheets (A5 folded pages)
My template: https://files.catbox.moe/q7cdsu.pdf; print and enjoy.

**Use when:**
- You understand something and want to make it future-you friendly
- A concept/step/shortcut is clearly useful beyond just today
- It’s from a trusted source: teacher/notes/book
- You want to mark it for transfer (to Obsidian / flashcard)

>“If you’d explain it to a clone of you who's weaker and sleepier — it’s capture.”
### The ‘Hybrid’ Moves
- **Solve in rough → Summarize on capture**
	- Perfect for hard questions, error analysis, exam prep
- **Discover something in rough → Transfer to capture (then Obsidian)**
    - Shortcut, pattern, general insight = golden.
- **Learn from teacher → Capture directly**
    - Don’t filter wisdom through mess. Log it clean while it's hot.
## Supplementary
- Learning a shorthand like [Stone Optimised Shorthand](https://github.com/jamesstoneco/stone-optimized-shorthand)

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to think more mathematically that you become a Math Terminator.

What the hell is this for? Write a punchy purpose here.  
*Ex: "Build a morning ritual system that slaps so hard it makes waking up a religious act."*

## 🧠 Why It Matters (aka Existential Justification)

Because this aligns with this commandment:
>I am a problem-solving machine. I never settle.

I love mathematics, logic and thinking. I want to sharpen my mind to think more deeply and to solve problems (on paper and in real life) more efficiently. Also because I don't want to suck in my favorite subject.

I am thinking of pursuing my undergrads in Abstract Math / Cs / or adjacent. The sooner I start, the better.

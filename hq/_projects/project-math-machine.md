## 🎯 Objective

Learn to think more mathematically that you become a Math Terminator.
## 🧠 Why It Matters (aka Existential Justification)

Because this aligns with this commandment:
>I am a problem-solving machine. I never settle.

I love mathematics, logic and thinking. I want to sharpen my mind to think more deeply and to solve problems (on paper and in real life) more efficiently. Also because I don't want to suck in my favorite subject.

<s>I am thinking of pursuing my undergrads in Abstract Math / Cs / or adjacent.</s> I have decided to get into CMI for a Math/CS degree. The sooner I start, the better.

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Finish Introduction to Mathematical Thinking ([Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking))
- [ ] Finish Reading "How To Solve It" by G. Polya. 
- [-] Solve **AoPS Intro Series** problems
	- kind of unavailable; but will try Vol 1
- [ ] Other Books:
	- [ ] *The Art and Craft of Problem Solving* - Zeitz

Also:

1. **You’re solving ≥50 % of IOQM problems** by September.
2. **By December**, you’re consistently writing clean, complete proofs for Pasquale/Andreescu problems under timed conditions.
3. **In January–February**, your board paper scores are ≥85 % in mocks.
4. **After March 11**, you can reliably solve **4 out of 6** CMI problems (with full rigor) in a 3-hour window.
5. **Your error log shrinks**—fewer repeated idiotic mistakes; more elegant moves.

## 🛠️ Tools + System

- Practice Material !!!
- A Math journal to log difficult problems (Obsidian can help)
	- thinking of using my newsletter / blog 'mathventure' column to dump solutions and proofs.
- Anki to remember methods used to solve problems
- Progressive Overload: increase difficulty over time.
	- Using solve rate: `(total correct problems x avg. difficulty) / total problem solved`
	- Errors per week
## 📆 Timeline / Phases

Closely aligned to [Project Ultralearning](https://nibirsan.org/war-of-becoming/projects/project-ultralearning/); almost a pre-req


(UPDATE) Thanks to ChatGPT, I got this very rough draft of the phases:

### 🔧 Phase 0 (June 1 – June 9) – Set Up Your Arsenal

1. **Build Your System**
   * Grab three notebooks or digital folders:
     1. **Math Problems** (Zeitz & IOQM)
     2. **Error Log & Reflections**
     3. **Physics/Chem Notes**
   * Download/print IOQM, RMO, INMO, and CMI past papers; stash them in a folder.
2. **Kick Off Zeitz**
   * Start with Chapter 1; solve 1–2 problems per day, writing full solutions.
   * If you finish early, peek at Chapter 2 examples or re-solve the same problem in a different way.
3. **Micro-Ultralearn Physics & Chemistry**
   * Identify your top-5 board topics per subject.
   * Each morning, spend 30 minutes reading the NCERT/OpenStax section for one topic, then 30 minutes solving 3–5 problems.
   * Create one Anki flashcard per day for a new formula/synthesis/reaction.
4. **Get a Taste of IOQM Pain**
   * On June 3 or 4, take a timed 2-hour IOQM past paper—no pressure, just feel the burn.
   * The next day, review your attempt, log your “Error of the Day” for every problem you screwed up.
5. **Lock in the Error-Logging Habit**
   * Every evening, write one sentence:
     * “Error I made today: \_\_\_\_\_\_. Why? \_\_\_\_\_\_. Next time: \_\_\_\_\_\_.”

### 🏋️ Phase 1 (June 10 – September 10) – IOQM Grind + Physics/Chem Ultralearning

1. **Master IOQM-Style Problem Solving**
   * Treat IOQM as your daily boss: solve 2–3 IOQM/RMO problems every day under timed conditions.
   * After each attempt, immediately log your mistakes and re-solve any unsolved problems within 2–3 days.
2. **Finish Zeitz & Supplement with “Challenge & Thrill”**
   * Push Zeitz through Chapters 3–5 by mid-August (solve every problem fully).
   * Whenever Zeitz is done, switch to “Challenge & Thrill of Pre-College Math” to absorb the Indian contest flavor.
3. **Ultra-Ultralearn Physics & Chemistry**
   * Define a weekly rotation: daily focus on one board topic in Physics or Chemistry.
   * For each topic, read its NCERT/OpenStax chapter and solve 5–7 past board or JEE problems—no skimping.
   * Keep adding flashcards for formulas, derivations, and reaction mechanisms.
   * Every weekend, sit for a “mini board mock” (pick 5–7 physics + 5–7 chemistry questions) and log errors.
4. **Add “Andreescu/Pasquale Lite” Starting July**
   * By late July, pick one Andreescu or Pasquale section (for example, a foundational Number Theory or Algebra chapter) and solve 2–3 problems daily.
   * Continue this until September, so you’re not blind-sided by tougher proof-style questions later.
5. **Weekly Mock & Review**
   * Every Sunday, do a timed IOQM mock (2–3 hours), grade yourself, and list your “Top 3 Screw-Ups.”
   * Reflect: “Am I stuck too long on a particular trick? Which technique do I need to practice next?”

### 🔥 Phase 2 (September 11 – December 31) – CMI Core Math + Board Studies Ramp

1. **Transition to CMI-Style Math Books**
   * Dump Zeitz for heavier artillery: deep-dive into “Problem Solving Tactics” (Pasquale) and Andreescu’s “Mathematical Olympiad Challenges.”
   * Pick one chapter per month (e.g., Invariants or Extremal Principle first), fully solve 3–4 problems, and write detailed proofs.
2. **Attack “An Excursion in Mathematics” (Modak)**
   * Tackle 20 of Modak’s trickiest problems by year-end—no fluff. Make sure each solution is written cleanly, as if for publication.
3. **Keep IOQM Momentum via Hybrid Mocks**
   * Every two weeks, mix CMI + IOQM + RMO problems to simulate curveballs. Solve under timed conditions and log “Error Archetypes” (e.g., “missed injectivity” or “failed case analysis”).
4. **Board Exam Catch-Up & Stabilization**
   * Identify any board topics you’re weak on (from your mini mocks). Devote 2–3 sessions weekly to those topics.
   * Use O.P. Tandon or Modern ABC for Chemistry reactions/mechanisms, and HC Verma or Resnick & Halliday for Physics concepts.
   * By December, aim to nail 80–90 % of all board-level questions in practice tests.
5. **Embrace Proof Rigor & LaTeX**
   * For each CMI-level problem you solve, instantly create a LaTeX write-up: one clean PDF proof, well-typeset.
   * Post select proofs on AoPS/Obsidian/Blog for feedback. This builds clarity of expression and spotlights hidden mistakes.
6. **Error-Log Review Sundays**
   * Every Sunday evening, scan the past week’s error log. Identify your top 3 recurring idiot mistakes (sloppy algebra, case-dropping, misreading).
   * Plan “micro-drills” to obliterate these mistakes next week.

### ⚔️ Phase 3 (January 1 – March 10) – Boards Finalization + CMI Maintenance

1. **Board Exam Domination**
   * For the first two months (Jan–Feb), put **85 % of your energy** into Physics and Chemistry boards.
   * Each day, practice full board questions: one Physics topic + one Chemistry topic in the morning, then review the error log.
   * By February end, aim to consistently hit **85 %+** on full board papers under timed conditions.
2. **Minimal CMI Math Maintenance**
   * Keep the CMI gears turning with **one proof problem per day** (CMI, RMO, or INMO). Solve for 60 minutes—even if you’re exhausted.
   * Spend 15 minutes reviewing a critical theorem or trick in Anki to keep the math spark alive.
3. **Physical & Mental Health Checkpoints**
   * Sleep 7–8 hours every night. No negotiating.
   * Keep up a 30–45 minute workout 4× a week—anything to clear brain fog.
   * Reserve one evening/week for hobbies or philosophy reading to avoid burning out.
4. **Board Mega Mocks & Review**
   * Every weekend, simulate a full set of board papers (Physics + Chemistry + Math).
   * Correct them immediately, log “Top 5 Errors,” and plan Monday’s review to address those.

### 👑 Phase 4 (March 11 – May 4) – Full-Blown CMI Grind (Final Boss)

1. **Unleash Relentless CMI Mocks**
   * From March 11 onward, CMI is your sole focus. Do **one past CMI paper every weekday** under strict conditions.
   * Immediately grade yourself, log “Top 3 Screw-Ups,” and “Top 3 Elegant Moves.” Then re-solve your screw-ups within 24 hours.
2. **Targeted Weakness Blitz**
   * Use your cumulative error log to find your two biggest blind spots (e.g., “functional equations,” “combinatorial geometry”).
   * Every weekend, dedicate 2 hours to **3–4 problems** exclusively on that topic until the gap is gone.
3. **Keep Stamina Sharp**
   * Simulate full-length exam conditions: no water bottle, no breaks, no distractions. Build the “mental endurance” to sit unbroken for 3 hours.
   * Taper down in the final week: no new problems, just light review of your compiled “Screw-Ups” list. Sleep >7 hours nightly.
4. **Finalize the Theorem Bank & Proof Elegance**
   * Create a one-page summary of 20–30 must-know results (e.g., Cauchy-Schwarz variants, common inequality patterns, standard combinatorial lemmas).
   * Read one or two expertly written proofs of problems you’ve solved. Study how they structure arguments, then refine your own write-ups accordingly.
5. **Mental & Physical Pre-Exam Ritual**
   * One week before the exam, drop all heavy lifting. Do only **light review** of your “Screw-Ups” list and Theorem Bank.
   * Simulate your test-day routine
     1. Wake at 5:30 AM, hydrate, stretch.
     2. Warm up with a single easy olympiad proof (20 minutes).
     3. Show up to the exam mindset: “I’ve already fought this war.”
   * During the exam, flag problems early—if you’re stuck for 20 minutes, pivot. Trust your training.

## 🎯 Objective

Assimilate and apply the Ultralearning method to learn hard things faster and enjoy deep satisfaction via self directed learning.
## 🧠 Why It Matters (aka Existential Justification)

- I have been a self-directed learner for mostly all my life, and this only enhances that.
- I love autonomy, and this gives me the upperhand to get *more* autonomy, by doing/learning the thing better.
- This way, I can actually become a polymath in the modern sense.
- I will be able to apply my knowledge to good use.
- I enjoy deep work.

## ✅ Success Criteria

**See [Project Math Machine](https://nibirsan.org/war-of-becoming/projects/project-math-machine/) for what to do.** It's like the parent project for this one.

- [ ] Finish listening/reading to Ultralearning
- [ ] Make a video on Ultralearning
- [ ] Metalearning things
- [ ] Apply tools like drilling and testing in **physics-chemistry-math**.
- [ ] Be more direct and use project-based learning for **programming**.
- [ ] Do things one at a time.

## 🛠️ Tools + System

- Notes on Ultralearning (obsidian)
- Anki to remember the lessons
- Making it visible (in my blog, etc.)
- Creating something with the knowledge 
	- e.g. explaining a physics concept in streams.

## 📆 Timeline / Phases

Break into chunks so it doesn't feel like eating an elephant raw:

- [ ] Phase 1: Reading and understanding what Ultralearning is.
- [ ] Phase 2: Apply isolated principles in specific activities (phy/chem, math, programming).
- [ ] Phase 3: Combine multiple principles into the activities.
- [ ] Phase 4: Make it a second nature.

## 📈 Progress Log

| Date       | What I Did                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2025-05-26 | Started reading Ultralearning, resonated with it a lot |
| 2025-05-28 | Used *metalearning* to prep for my IP Speedrun.        |
| 2025-05-29 | The IP Speedrun in 2 days                              |

## 💥 Wins
- [The IP Speedrun](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo9XlrGEbSghlVnbvSUS_8agNEHFbL29B&si=6zBtXMmXaCFawfa8) was a very nice Ultralearning project. Though it was a bit rough, we're off to a good start.

## 📓 Reflections

Once you're done (or halfway through), write:

- What you learned
- What sucked
- What worked
- What you’d improve

### 🔥 What I Did

- was more focused during workouts
- studying was fun.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- i hate mediocrity, and this is getting beyond that.
- i am trying to be who I want to be.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- I can do this. It is fairly easy.
- I need to improve the last two sessions
    - don't put any heavy mental-effort-y work there. keep things simple, stupid.

### 🪓 Next Step
- day 2 and finishing W8 of IMT.

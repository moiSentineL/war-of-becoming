# [🏆] endurance

**Date:** 2025-06-04
**Time Spent:** 6h

---

### 🔥 What I Did
- endured through an IOQM paper for 2.5h straight. we like suffering.
    - i almost solved one. i was *this* close.
- forced myself to recall everything i have learned so far in 12th grade physics (for the greater good).

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- helps build neural pathways to solutions.
- ultralearning go brrr
- recalling is better than reviewing

### 🧠 What I Learned
- ultralearning is stressful, but rewarding.
- i gotta grind, bro.
- i burnt out from 7h hours of streaming and so on. don't do that shit. you need breaks as well. you're not a moron, but a human.

### 🪓 Next Step
- endure further. for the long term. don't crash and burn.

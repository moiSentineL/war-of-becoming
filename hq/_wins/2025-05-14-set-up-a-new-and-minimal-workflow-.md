# [🏆] set up a new and minimal workflow

**Date:** 2025-05-14  
**Time Spent:** ~10h

### 🔥 What I Did
- i revamped my workspace to include the thinkpad and made it more minimal and modular.
- better cable management
- aiming for a more productive experience by removing a monitor.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- change is the only constant.
- I am creating a better system for my content creation + knowledge working + productivity.
- i am good at this.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- systems building takes time.
- the configurations take a *lot* of time then expected. make sure you adjust that on the next forecasts.
- this is very nice, the whole linux experience, but takes a FUCKING ABYSMAL amount of time. 

### 🪓 Next Step
- getting back the NEW equilibrium state.
- obs config using the old laptop and nice streaming.

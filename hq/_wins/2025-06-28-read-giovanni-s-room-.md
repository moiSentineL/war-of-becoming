### 🔥 What I Did
- read Giovanni's Room. and man, it was enlightening.
- but so very tragic. I want to get drunk right now (with caffeine ofc, i don't condone alcohol) and cry.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- it made me realise a lot of important things about love, people, and how we engage in friendship and relationship, and how it all matters so very much. 

### 🧠 What I Learned
- i think i will make a blog on it to consolidate everything. this was a very intense read.

### 🪓 Next Step
- journal. and think. and reflect.

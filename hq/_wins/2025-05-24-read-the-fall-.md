### 🔥 What I Did
- I read Albert Camus's _The Fall_ today.
- Wrote a small [blogpost](https://nibirsan.org/blog/p/the-fall/) about it as well.
- Some serious introspection.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- It was more difficult than the type of literature I actually read nowadays. So it was kind of progressive.
- I was on a position where I could understand Camus here, but not FULLY grasp him. So yeah, the second read (~2-5 year later) will be much worth it.
- Got me thinking about my own megalomania.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- People are shit. So are you.
- You think you're a Good Samaritan, but you're always driven by unknown, unrecognisable ulterior motives.

### 🪓 Next Step
- read some more deep shit. preferably related to philosophy.

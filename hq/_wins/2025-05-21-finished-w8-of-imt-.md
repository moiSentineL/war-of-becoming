### 🔥 What I Did
- finished w8. the last week with course material. 
- it felt kinda bland. maybe because it felt a bit more difficult than usual.
- but damn. I did it.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- one step closer.
- only the test flight think remains.
- it was actually the hardest week, perhaps.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- real analysis
- the Epsilon definition of limits
- proving limits and other stuff.
- super cool!

### 🪓 Next Step
- do the test flight problem set.

# [🏆] day 1 of the IP Speedrun

**Date:** 2025-05-29  
**Time Spent:** 9h 

---

### 🔥 What I Did
- the first part of the IP speedrun, which consisted of the Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`) and societal bs.
- I did some coding, made notes, explained shit on camera.
- and also fucked up sometimes.
- streaming + explaining + doing stuff is kinda hard.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- I stepped out of my comfort zone.
- I took it as a challenge, and I got to it. I am on a momentum, my man.
- I confronted my fears.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- take fucking breaks, doesn't matter if you're on stream or not. don't burn out.
- set up buffers. always. 
- try to make it less distracting.
- you have to keep your health in check.
- share your stuff to people, just do it. it's a pascal's wager.

### 🪓 Next Step
- part 2! make it count, son.

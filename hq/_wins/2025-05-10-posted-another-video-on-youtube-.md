# [🏆] posted another video on youtube

**Date:** 2025-05-10  
**Time Spent:** 4.5h 

---

### 🔥 What I Did
- posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SkziMeyF-8&list=PLo9XlrGEbSgjy32OtVwOtkbIv92woEUAi&index=1&pp=gAQBiAQB) on Thinking, Fast and Slow.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- it felt really good to keep this creative side of me (i love video editing and stuff!)
- i did it in 4.5h, everything.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- there is no point in doing any other workflow that droidcam + obs. it works pretty fine for short videos. 
- i should directly use Windows for recording + editing. sigh :( 
    - but my vsts and stuff are in Linux???? hmm something to think about.
- i need to optimise my video posting routine- based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYNzZTO4Ctk)

### 🪓 Next Step
- ip speedrun. might postpone to W21.

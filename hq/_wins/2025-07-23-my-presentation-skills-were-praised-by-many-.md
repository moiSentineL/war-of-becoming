### 🔥 What I Did
- It was school inspection day (and the reason why I couldn't log my wins), and I was to give a science demo together with a friend to help me out.
- Now, my presentation was so charismatic, that everyone was captivated. The school assembly was super, super nice. 
- one of the school principals from the inspecting team literally gave me a pen. everyone was comparing that to *that* scene from 3 Idiots.
- he also invited me to his school and give a presentation there.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- i think it shows that if I am confident, then I can make anything happen. But I was also very nervous; I was very afraid even. But I knew that I could trust my skills, that I have done this before, and I can do it again. 
- possible connection with principals?

### 🧠 What I Learned
- that teamwork pays off (thanks Masaud for helping me out)
- trust your abilities. if you know you are good at it, then nothing can crush you. don't let anything take you down.

### 🪓 Next Step
- well, inspection's over, now's the time to get back on track slowly.
- starting with the timing, then with the studying.
- i think i will either do some writing or study linear algebra/math

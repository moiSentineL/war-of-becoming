### 🔥 What I Did
- made a video on things to after 10th boards.
- it took me a lot of time though. I need to optimise that, and my editing workflow.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- new students might benefit from these things. maybe they'll get an idea of what to do.
- i experimented with a new workflow. it was flawed, things can be very much improved.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- i have to upgrade my workflow.
- the biggest pain in the ass is finding the right music.

### 🪓 Next Step
- crack the hackathon (ft. Satvik)

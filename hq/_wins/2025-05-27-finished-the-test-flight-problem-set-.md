# [🏆] finished the test flight problem set

**Date:** 2025-05-27  
**Time Spent:**  so much. 

---

### 🔥 What I Did
- finally submitted the test flight problem set, the last problem set for IMT.
- the solutions are posted [here](https://github.com/moiSentineL/imt-tfps/) as well.
- damn, the last two questions were NICEEE.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- last problem set means being 90% ahead of the average person who starts this journey.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Writing GOOD proofs.
- It was so much fun.

### 🪓 Next Step
- review some proofs as well, but most importantly, print Paul Zeitz's _The Art and Craft of Problem Solving_ and start doing progressive overload.

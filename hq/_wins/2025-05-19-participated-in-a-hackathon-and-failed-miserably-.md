**Time Spent:** 11h

### 🔥 What I Did
- participated in a 5h late night hackathon (CodeSprint LA '25)
- failed miserably in DSA.
- was fucking sleepy.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- i was pushing my comfort zone to limits.
- satvik made me want to improve my comp sci skills (and i fucking will)

### 🧠 What I Learned
- never do late night hackathons or else get fucked.
- learned how to do some loop constructs and math-y problems.
- i kind of like competivive programming.

### 🪓 Next Step
- get better at math.

### 🔥 What I Did
- finished the test flight evaluation exercises. (Not the actual grading, mind you).
- it was very very very nice.
- I also got a "good" from someone in my test problem set.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- because I am _this_ close to getting my grades
- by evaluating proofs, i am learning what good (and bad) proofs look like.
- i love this.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- "you cannot get partial credit for being wrong"
- "being a mathematician is also to be a good writer"
- some math.

### 🪓 Next Step
- do the evaluations
- but first, get some Zeitz done

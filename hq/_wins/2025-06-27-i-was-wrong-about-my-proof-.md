**Date:** 2025-06-27  
**Time Spent:** ~3h

### 🔥 What I Did
- i was wrong about my proof that i [posted yesterday](https://math.nibirsan.org/posts/proving-2n-n3-for-all-n-9-wrong/).
- someone on the iTeachChem discord pointed out my mistakes (thank you so much!)
- and i spent about 2.5h fixing it and fixing it again.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- i learned a lot.
- it was very very interesting
- never solved an inequality-induction problem before.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- don't overestimate your abilities
- don't fuck with logarithm if you don't need to.
- always get your hands dirty, even if it is a problem to prove and not solve.

### 🪓 Next Step
- solve more problems

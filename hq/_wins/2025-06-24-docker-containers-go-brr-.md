**Time Spent:** 2h

### 🔥 What I Did
- fiddled more with docker containers. this was probably the most valuable thing i got to know last week.
- and i did some more stuff today: 
  - jellyfin server to serve my course lectures
  - proxy
  - some configs to make things better.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- because this is another skill in my arsenal!

### 🧠 What I Learned
- `docker-compose` is radical.

### 🪓 Next Step
- finish the experiment with wallabag

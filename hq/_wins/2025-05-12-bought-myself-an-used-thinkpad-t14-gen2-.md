### 🔥 What I Did
- got myself an used ThinkPad T14 Gen2 AMD for 35k INR. it feels amazing.
- i negotiated the price, talked to the shopkeepers and so on (I wasn't that outgoing before)
- (tried) installed arch. still on the verge of making it work beter.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- because I prevented e-waste by buying something used.
- this will last me a lifetime.
- it was a good fucking deal.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- looking for refurbished / used laptops? go local first.
- you gotta have patience while installing Arch. also, pick mental peace over anything.

### 🪓 Next Step
- get the new laptop upto working capacity (bare minimum config)

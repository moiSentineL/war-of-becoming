### 🔥 What I Did
- read The Great Gatsby. It was an interesting read. I usually read more existential and introspective novels, but this one was more *social* and *practical*. I don't think I can say too much about it, but I would very much like to read it again someday.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- reading keeps your brain sharp
- and also makes you a better person.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- marriage on the basis of security are stable, but it makes you stifle.
- oh the things people do for money and love.

### 🪓 Next Step
- read books that make you a better person

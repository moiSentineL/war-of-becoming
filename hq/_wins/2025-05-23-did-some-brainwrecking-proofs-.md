# [🏆] did some brainwrecking proofs

**Date:** 2025-05-23  
**Time Spent:** 3.5h

### 🔥 What I Did
- did around 4.5 proofs from the IMT Test Flight problem set. You may be able to visit this in [this repo](https://github.com/moisentinel/imt-tfps) someday in the future.
- I had to think deeply. it was pretty nice.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- I learned more on how to communicate math, rather than just doing math.
- I am one step closer to finishing the whole course. It's gonna be amazing.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to write NEAT proofs on LaTeX. 
- How to polish things up.
- How to turn madness into organised chaos.

### 🪓 Next Step
- do some more math, but from school, i guess.

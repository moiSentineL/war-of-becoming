**Date:** 2025-06-12  
**Time Spent:** ?

---

### 🔥 What I Did
the whole day was a waste. 
but that's not the point. 
the point is, 'why?'
why did that happen?

i lost a battle, but not the war. 
i will make sure that this doesn't happen again.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- i understand that i depend on tools like internet, Obsidian, electricity, etc. a lot. 

### 🧠 What I Learned
- i love _control_. that's fucking bad. i need to set anti-fragile systems, instead of depending on stuff. 
- i have set up a fallback routine when something bad happens.
- this is a method of procrastination.

### 🪓 Next Step
- don't make the same mistake again.

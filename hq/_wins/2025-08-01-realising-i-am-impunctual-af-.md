### 🔥 What I Did 
i am not punctual. i am never early. rarely on time. almost always late.
i don't know why inside i am going "it's okay, i've got time". i mean, i know _memento mori_. but i get sucked into things.

is it the side effect of trying to do so much?

### 🪓 Next Step
i will try to find out why it happens and fix it.

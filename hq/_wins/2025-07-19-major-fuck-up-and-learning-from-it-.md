# [🏆] major fuck-up (and learning from it)

**Date:** 2025-07-19  
**Time Spent:** 2h?

### 🔥 What I Did
I finished shooting for a video. When I pulled the footage into Premiere Pro, I saw that the audio was crackling and clipping.
**Reason?** Sample rate was mismatched; mic (windows) - 44.1 KHz, OBS - 48 KHz.

That entire footage now has to be re-recced.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Always do a trial run. NO MATTER HOW SKILLED YOU ARE.
- Always check the audio. 

### 🪓 Next Step
- probably keep a constant checklist before starting any video shooting/editing. -> make the list/routine system.
- re-record the footage tomorrow, but no editing.

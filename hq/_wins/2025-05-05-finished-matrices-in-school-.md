### 🔥 What I Did
- finished all the stuff related to Matrices for school (12th NCERT)
- sure, I already learned the stuff about a year ago, but the practicing helped a lot.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- I practiced stuff and got slightly better.
- I got to know more things that before. (knowledge compounds!)

### 🧠 What I Learned
- matrix multiplication still baffles me.

### 🪓 Next Step
- finish determinants (12th NCERT)

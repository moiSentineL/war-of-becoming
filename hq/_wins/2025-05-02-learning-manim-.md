**Date:** 2025-05-02  
**Time Spent:** 1.3h

### 🔥 What I Did
- I created a few animations:

![skew sym](https://pixvid.org/images/2025/05/02/skew-sym.gif)

And it felt super nice!

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- because I have one more tool in my arsenal which I can use to make cool things.
- I had to brush up my read-the-docs-Nibir.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- I learned how to use manim (really the basics).
- I learned a few objects and things inside it.

### 🪓 Next Step
- make this repo into a public website.

### 🔥 What I Did

### 🎯 Why It Matters

### 🧠 What I Learned
- consolidating previous info + removing myths.
- learning new stuff like adjoint matrices, inverses and how they are a pain in the ass.

### 🪓 Next Step
- get better at finding the adjoint matrices and write that shit down.
- do some physics.

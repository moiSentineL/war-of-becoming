# [🏆] made music over remote

**Date:** 2025-06-21
**Time Spent:** 8h

### 🔥 What I Did
- tried to create a workflow to make music over remote with my buddy priyanshu. 
- it took us around 6 hours to get everything set up (sunshine over internet, tailscale vpn, audio transmission) so that priyanshu could: 1) control my pc 2) be the audio engineer.
- we ended up recording the old parts from our previous demo 'heart in a blender'. nice!

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- because it's beautiful.
- because we love doing it!

### 🧠 What I Learned
- how to set up tailscale + sunshine + moonlight to connect pcs better
- how to transmit audio from DAW, without much latency over the internet
- how it feels like to work with another person there to help record stuff.

### 🪓 Next Step
- possibly write a blog on the workflow?

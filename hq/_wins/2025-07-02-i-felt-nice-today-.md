### 🔥 What I Did
- i went to school and actually enjoyed.
- i enjoyed the relation and communication with my friends, my juniors, and my teachers. 
- i felt really good, especially when i talked to Devendra Sir after a long time.
- one teacher asked me about my streams, and that felt good. 
- another junior did the same. 

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- it gives me hope, that things aren't so bad. 
- it shows that i am doing *something*. That I am not *rotten*.
- and it makes me want to improve myself more and more and more.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- relations give meaning. you have to pause and admire it. you have to ritualise it
- i got this.

### 🪓 Next Step
- the war. keep on fighting it, baby

# [🏆] finished W7 of IMT

**Date:** 2025-05-07  
**Time Spent:** 4h

### 🔥 What I Did
- Finished the W7 or Module 7 of Introduction to Mathematical Thinking course (coursera), which involved an intro to rigorous proofs in (and out) of number theory, divisibility and evaluation of proofs.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- because I learned a bit more about what makes a proof better.
- I am one step closer to finishing the course and fulfill my monthly goal.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- a bit of number theory and why it is important (grinding that in Alcumus btw)
- how to prove something like the divisibility theorem, although it still confuses me a bit.

### 🪓 Next Step
- W8 and more grinding in Alcumus and doing oly level problems.

# [🏆] navigating through school attendance bs

**Date:** 2025-08-04  
**Time Spent:** ~3h

### 🔥 What I Did
- basically, school has been pestering me because i don't go to school that often. it's the poor fucking rules enforced by CBSE that binds them.
- so, i tried/am trying to find a way to maintain things: study, creative side AND attendance.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- because no attendance => can't give exams

### 🧠 What I Learned
- you can't break down. it's not your fault, but your responsibility. 
- it's a math optimisation problem. you can deal with it.

### 🪓 Next Step
- go to school this week, then see what happens

### 🔥 What I Did
- finally completed the whole series, and i was about to cry by the end.
- man, math is so beautiful.

the whole series changed me as a mathematician. 
i learned a lot. and man, how i want to write about it.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- i learned few of the most profound concepts needed it modern applied math.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- matrix transformations
- determinants and geometric interpretations
- vectors; dot products, cross products
- inverse, column space, null
- mathematical duality
- basis and change
- eigenvectors and eigenvalues
- abstract vector spaces
- and much more!

### 🪓 Next Step
write about it!

# [🏆] did a full reflection on an internetless environment

**Date:** 2025-05-31  
**Time Spent:** 4h

### 🔥 What I Did
- did a full reflection, stuff like "what's important", "what matters the most", "where I am headed"
- all in that room above. without internet. just me, journals, and my thinkpad for some music.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- because i know more about myself now, and what i want to become.
- this reflection was very, very important and much needed.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- i debug better when i talk it out loud, so i recorded myself doing so.
- it's never too late to start.
- we are brainwashed from childhood, but we can always recognise them and fix them.

### 🪓 Next Step
- concrete goalsetting and execution

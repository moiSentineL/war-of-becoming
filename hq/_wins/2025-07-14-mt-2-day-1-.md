**Time Spent:** school day

### 🔥 What I Did
- i had my chem monthly test.
- i had fun solving it.
- not sure about *how* it was exactly, because i didn't study `d and f blocks`. 
- but i think it was okay enough.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- good revision test.
- problem solving feels nice anyway.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- i gotta put some work on d-and-f block.

### 🪓 Next Step
- don't forget what you learned lol

### 🔥 What I Did
- reviewed some of my peers, which was the last thing to do in the course. 
- And we are done!

After 5 months of waiting and waiting for the right time and waiting for exams to finish, I am finally done.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- because i fucking love math. And this made me love math even more!
- why the fuck should it not?

### 🧠 What I Learned
- writing proofs
- grading proofs
- tools like quantifiers, mathematical induction, limits, set theory, (basic) number theory and real analysis. 
- super nice!

### 🪓 Next Step
- do real (olympiad) math grind.

### 🔥 What I Did
- another day of learning physics and thinking about it
- another day of breaking self-imposed rules and developing better systems.
- another day of watching Walter Lewin teach flawlessly.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- i was weak at physics, but now i am understanding it better. much better.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- electric potential + electrostatic potential energy | and their difference
- shielding, faraday cage
- equipotentials, etc.

### 🪓 Next Step
- do the MIT 8.02x problem set 1

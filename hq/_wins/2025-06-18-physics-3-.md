### 🔥 What I Did
- really liked Walter Lewin's lectures and really getting the intuition about certain things right.
- also, did some problems and testing, which was pretty cool.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- i am sort of liking physics!
- it feels really good to actually think and have a better intuition.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- capacitance
- finally understood what dielectrics do!

### 🪓 Next Step
- need to recall the answers to the problems i had written down in the session

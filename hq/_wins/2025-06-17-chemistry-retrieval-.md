### 🔥 What I Did
- i tried to solve problems and recall stuff after not touching chemistry for about a month.
- and it went pretty worse.
- couldn't do 70% of the problems. and that's pretty fucked, because it was not even HIGH level stuff.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- this is a very important step for ultralearning something: you gotta grease the groove and get fucked a little so that you can learn better in the long term.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- that i should have created anki cards MORE than making obsidian notes. 
    - now I will limit myself to very sparse oneliner / tl;dr type notes.
    - and i can always import back to obsidian from anki.
    - and it might be a good way to recall stuff again from scratch by making super concise notes.
- i gotta do this.

### 🪓 Next Step
can't do chem this week though, so better do physics

# [🏆] posted a video on taking questions as notes + systems

**Date:** 2025-07-24  
**Time Spent:** ~10h

### 🔥 What I Did
- posted a video on taking questions as notes.
- one of my best videos yet, but took a lot of time. so never again (except once in a while)

- so, i tried setting up a proper workflow for making my videos so that i don't spend more time than needed.
- i realised that it was too tied in my identity, but i don't want to make perfect videos. i just want to make *my* videos.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- useful video yayyy!
- helped me learn a lot of systems lessons.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- that i should create systems for making videos as well. 
- everything requires some level of structure

### 🪓 Next Step
- follow the structure.

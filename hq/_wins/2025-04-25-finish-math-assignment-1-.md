### 🔥 What I Did
Finished the 40 problems on the assignment for 12th Grade Math Chapter "Relations and Functions". Sure, I still have a few doubts, but this was very nice.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
It cleared most of my doubts for the chapter. The methods are now _engraved_ onto my mind. Plus, I love discrete math.

### 🧠 What I Learned
New methods to prove stuff. I could use the lessons I learned from my IMT course.

### 🪓 Next Step
Do the next assignment.

# [🏆] started doing proofs on my own

**Date:** 2025-05-22  
**Time Spent:** 2h

### 🔥 What I Did
- I started doing math proofs on my own. The last exercise. The last problem set for IMT. I am so fucking proud.
- I also did some Markdown -> LaTeX -> pdf exporting. That is super fucking nice.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- It pays to be able to _write_ a proof well.
- Learning to how to get  `pdf` files (via LaTeX) will be super useful when I'll be writing research papers. I should probably ankify this.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to do the export
- How to write better proofs.
- Thinking hard pays off.
- Restate, decompose and rebuild the problem.

### 🪓 Next Step
- do the rest of the proofs.

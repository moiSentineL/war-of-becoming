# [🏆] talked to friends after a long while

**Date:** 2025-06-19  
**Time Spent:** 2h

### 🔥 What I Did
- i talked to a couple of my friends whom I like and resonate with after a long time. 
- 2h of my study time was spent talking. and even though I felt guilty, I think I don't really need to. 
- because this moments are _rare_. they are spontaneous, and I think I would always cherish them.
- it was very very nice talkinge

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- i had been feeling really lonely since the last couple of days, so it felt really good to open up after a long time.
- conversations create ideas. 

### 🧠 What I Learned
- i am not a really good listener. I keep on trying to tell them _my_ things. that's not cool, and I need to work on that.
- i have a lot to think about. 
- we need to normalise taking deliberate breaks.

### 🪓 Next Step
- reflect? not sure lol

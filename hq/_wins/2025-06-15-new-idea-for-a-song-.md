### 🔥 What I Did
- found a new idea for a song from the beat Priyanshu sent me yesterday.
- i made quick scratch vocals, sent it to him and he was fucking excited. he played around with it the whole day.
- later in the evening, we did some stuff so that he can access my DAW remotely and be my audio engineer / mixing personnel.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- you never know what might happen with an idea
- all goes in my portfolio lol
- plus it is SUPER addicting.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- there exists something called `tailscale`. i gotta learn how to use that tool later.
- how to use `qjackctl` for audio routing and stuff.

### 🪓 Next Step
- record the vocals on saturday

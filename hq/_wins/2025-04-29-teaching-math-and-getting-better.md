### 🔥 What I Did
I taught some math at school to my class and applied the techniques I learned from "How to Solve It" by G. Polya.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- I was feeling a bit depressed at school, because it felt really unproductive. But the whiteboard made all the difference.
- I helped them consolidate some useful methods and ways to solve Matrix Multiplication.
- Teaching is the best way to learn.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to teach better.
- Where my downspots at teaching are: I try do teach in a very high level. That's bad. Working on it!

### 🪓 Next Step
- do the IMT problem set for W6

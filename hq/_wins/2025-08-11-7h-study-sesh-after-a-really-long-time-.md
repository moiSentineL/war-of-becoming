**Date:** 2025-08-11  
**Time Spent:** 7h 

---

### 🔥 What I Did
studied for more or less 7h.

- 2h physics - electromagnetic induction, emf, problems, mehdi vs lewin (lol, but understood bad probing => weird consequences)
- 2h o-chem (meta) - tried creating a new plan to learn organic chemistry. also some basic problems on nomenclature.
- 3h oly math - modular arithmetic, problems, theory.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
feels good! feels like i have accomplished something!

### 🧠 What I Learned
- that i should do some warm up problems before picking up the actual problems.

### 🪓 Next Step
- next day, next 7h sesh

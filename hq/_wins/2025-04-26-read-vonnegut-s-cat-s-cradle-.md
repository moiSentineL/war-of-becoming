### 🔥 What I Did
I read whole of Cat's Cradle today. And man, it was really interesting! I may write a review on it someday. It has a very different tone compared to the other Vonnegut books.


### 🎯 Why It Matters
I took time for myself and actually _read a fucking book_. Something you may have not done since kindergarten. It's good to read stuff.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Religion? Lies!
- How to make a false religion
- How to make a country of your own, and see the people starve while you make PR with other countries with a seemingly complacent smile.
- So it goes.

### 🪓 Next Step
- Read "If on a winter's night a traveler" by Italo Calvino. 
- Get crazy.

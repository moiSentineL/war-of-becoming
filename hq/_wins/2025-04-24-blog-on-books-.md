# [🏆] blog on books

**Date:** 2025-04-24  
**Time Spent:** about 2 hours
**Context:**  I wrote and published a blog post on the books I enjoyed in *my* style of writing.

### 🔥 What I Did
Wrote and post a blog post about the books that I enjoyed recently.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
1. Because I did that on my newsletter.
2. It was imperfect.
3. I tried to embrace my own style: less formal, somewhat snarky, and _me_.

### 🧠 What I Learned
Things are not that hard.
Done is the engine of more (cf. Cult of Done Manifesto)

### 🪓 Next Step
Crush the education system.

### 🔥 What I Did
- started a random alcumus livesolve stream.
- I think I partly humiliated myself by doing so, because I couldn't solve questions with finesse.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- Bled in public. That's how I give myself a taste of failure.
- I built a bit of confidence. 

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Doing shit live is hard. But we get to the sweet spot by being consistently sucking up to it and doing what matters.
- I need to learn the tables again.

### 🪓 Next Step
- learn the tables.

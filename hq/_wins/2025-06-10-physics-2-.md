### 🔥 What I Did
- day 2 of (re)learning physics. I forgot to log the previous one.
- learned physics from Walter Lewin. And fuck man, he is AWESOME!
- tried the new "no comprehensive notes, optimise for anki" notetaking strategy.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- i am trying to fall in love with physics again. fuck s**** sir.
- intuition >>> bullshit they teach in school.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- intuition on electrostatics and charges.
- flux! finally i understand it much better.

### 🪓 Next Step
explain the concepts to a 5 year old.

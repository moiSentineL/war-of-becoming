**Date:** 2025-07-28  
**Time Spent:**  n/a

### 🔥 What I Did
today was (almost) an ideal day. here's what happened:

- learned linear algebra (visual representations of matrices + vectors) - about 7/16 chapters from 3b1b (took ~4h)
    - never learned this so intuitively.
- started doing oly math again (~3h)
    - after a long time. did some planning
    - IOQM problems. couldn't solve many, but understood many things.

so like ~7h of focused study. that is pretty fucking rad.

and i did:
- made a cover of "Take on Me"!
- played guitar in between breaks
- played Return of the Obra Dinn (~30m) after studying.
- had a fun talk with my partner

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- peak day. 5/5. you need these too!

### 🧠 What I Learned
- napping at 12pm changes EVERYTHING.
- instead of waiting for so long to make coffee. 
    - pre-heat it
    - melt the crystals with normal temp water, make it dissolve.
    - later add hot water.
    - this is much more doable and doesn't taste burnt.

### 🪓 Next Step
- refine this tomorrow.

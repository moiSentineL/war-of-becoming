# [🏆] public website for the war repo

**Date:** 2025-05-03  
**Time Spent:** 3.5h 

---

### 🔥 What I Did
- made a public website for everything related to the war repo. now people can view my war in a website instead of the clunky github ui.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- i am making myself more public.
- i can access my stuff better.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- to make a jekyll blog from scratch.
- what goes on in websites and configs and templating. (i can make my math journal with finesse and in probably less time)

### 🪓 Next Step
- keep on updating stuff!

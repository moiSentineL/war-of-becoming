### 🔥 What I Did
- recorded the guitar parts for the rerec of "heart in a blender".
- probably not the final take, need to fuck around with the amp sims and stuff.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- i love playing music and fucking around with it.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- that i shouldn't use my amp as "studio monitors". it's awful.
- that i should probably practice before playing.

### 🪓 Next Step
- i probably need to adjust my truss rod as well...

### 🔥 What I Did
>Who says you need to be productive everyday?

Sometimes, you just need a day to be lazy AF. today was that day.

Actually, my plan was to meet a very close friend of mine, but something happened and the meeting got cancelled. 
So, I was left with a day with no schedule, no plans, a tired body and a want to do nothing.

- i read a lot today, tried new books. 
- watched youtube shorts; guiltless, for about an hour
- went shopping with my mom (after a long time! it was great!)
- made some food and enjoyed.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- this was much needed. i had been racing out for a long time. sometimes you gotta take a break from your monotone life.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- you don't need everyday to be productive. 
- sometimes you just need to be.

### 🪓 Next Step
- realise that you're not on cloud nine anymore and get back on track

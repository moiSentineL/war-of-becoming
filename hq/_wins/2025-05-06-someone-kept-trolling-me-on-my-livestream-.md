### 🔥 What I Did

- I tried to keep my cool while giving slow burns.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- It shows that people are trying to drag me down, which in turn shows that I have built something good.
- It gives me some experience on how to deal with people.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Keeping cool is the best thing ever.
- Don't let these little bastards get to you. Remember what you stand for.

### 🪓 Next Step
- keep on doing what you do: building, studying, growing.

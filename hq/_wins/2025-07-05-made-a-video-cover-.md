**Date:** 2025-07-05  
**Time Spent:** 7h

### 🔥 What I Did
- i don't know how to explain this, but i made a (not a real) video, where I played "Nothing Else Matters" by Metallica, and did a voiceover on how sometimes nothing works and you just want to do nothing in particular.
- also serves as a monologue

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- because i enjoy music + guitar. it matters to me.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- i need to work on my guitar skills. slowly. step by step. no pressure.
- i often turn the thing i love into stress. 
    - this often happens when i am making a video. 
    - i don't think i should pick any other task than to make a video on 2 of the saturdays.
- not everything has to be perfect.

### 🪓 Next Step
- *actually* learn the solo

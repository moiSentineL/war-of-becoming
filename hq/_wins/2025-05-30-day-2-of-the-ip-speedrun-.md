# [🏆] day 2 of the ip speedrun

**Date:** 2025-05-30  
**Time Spent:** 8h 

---

### 🔥 What I Did
- finished the remaining part of the syllabus.
- had real trouble because there was no electricity, but there was my thinkpad. 
- couldn't stream, and it was very sad.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- i finished the thing nonetheless.

here's what i said to my parents and my partner in the morning:
>"mere power outages cannot stop me".

and so they could not. they surely made things harder. but that's what I like.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- sql is pretty nice. i should actually use it on my projects.
- things can get weird sometimes, and then you can't do anything about them. stuff like natural calamities and all. 
    - the only way is to adapt to your scenario. 
    - "choose to walk, or be dragged."

### 🪓 Next Step
- reflect on my life, tomorrow. internet-less.
- consolidating everything on sunday.

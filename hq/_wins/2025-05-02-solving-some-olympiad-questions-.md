### 🔥 What I Did

    - solved [this one](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4002279_202425_ioqm_india) with finesse.
    - couldn't solve [this one](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2014_AMC_10A_Problems/Problem_15)
- And solved a bunch of questions from Alcumus - PreAlgebra

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- Because I am finally getting started!
- I am getting the feel of the type of problems

### 🧠 What I Learned
- I use "questions" instead of "problems"
- Some really nice number theory trick.

### 🪓 Next Step

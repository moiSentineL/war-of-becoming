These are the people / alter-egos I want to be:
## The Essentialist Polymath
- who learns things one by one and gets good at them.
- who can apply the acquired knowledge to create / do / build great things.
- focuses on the most essential.

## The Unwavered Ubermensch
- who doesn't shy away from going beyond comfort. 
- who embraces pain and suffering.
- who will do anything to be in control of themselves.

## The Efficient Ultralearner
- one who masters skills, not merely learn them.
- who is capable of learning hard things efficiently.
- who utilises all of the resources meticulously.

## The Focused Minimalist
- who maintains ruthless focus, and on the things that really matter.
- who will gladly discard anything that doesn't play a significant role in their lives and counter sunk-cost fallacy.
- who chooses the essential few over trivial many.

## The Immaculate Introspector
- who reflects, ruminates and rebuilds himself as frequently as possible.
- who tries to understand the deeper parts of himself and integrate them into their life.
- who stops making recurring mistakes and fix them.

## The  Not-so-rascal Rationalist
- who believes in the rational method and Bayesian thinking.
- who religiously optimises and debugs everything (until point of highest yield)
- who is humble.

## The Charismatic Leader
- who can guide other people to improvement and help them.
- who is confident, capable and resilient
- who takes on responsibility, even if it is not their fault.

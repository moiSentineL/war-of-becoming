# 🧠 Monthly Review
## I. Alignment Check 🔍  
> *Am I becoming who I said I want to become?*

- 🔥 Did I live my 7 commandments? (Rate 1–5)
	- 3
- 🧭 Did my actions align with my long-term goals?
	- Only few did (like math, IMT, IP speedrun, building better workflow)
- 💀 What felt pointless or misaligned?
	- the thinkpad slump week was super misaligned

## II. Wins + Progress 📈  
> *Proof I’m not rotting.*

- Top 3 tangible wins  
	- the IP Speedrun
	- made 3 bombastic videos that I LIKE.
	- went without porn (or the need of it) for the whole month. I am free.
- Systems I improved or debugged  
	- The whiteboard kanban/quote/day-rating
	- bedtime routine & shared journaling
	- minimal laptop workflow and linking between two
	- avoiding slacking off and information overload
- Projects I advanced (+ status)  
	- IMT
		- all done except the evaluation part, which should be pretty cool and done in one day.
	- Math Machine
		- I got through more problems, but I need to get better at it man.
	- Ultralearning -> should start it.
	- deep reflections and mid-year review:
		- i searched who i wanted to be
		- my flaws and how to fix them
		- and decided where I want to go (CMI, I am coming.)
- 1 thing I handled like a badass
	- making videos~

## III. Fails + Feedback 💣  
> *Where I sucked. What I’ll do about it.*

- Top 3 fails  
	- Couldn't finish math part 1.
		- because of the thinkpad slump week, everything was fucked.
	- My hackathon (w/ Satvik) went to shit.
		- I had weak theory, plus late night.
	- my sleep routine was (and still is) fucked. but i am solving that.
- What broke down (system-wise)?  
	- I was unable to get back on track after the slump week. 
	- Timings everyday and slacking off -> solved later
	- couldn't study anything school related.
- Root causes (internal + external)  
	- Internally, I didn't want to go beyond comfort zone.
		- but no, **I am become Ubermensch, the destroyer of mediocrity.**
	- Externally, the whole house was a bit scattered; everyone was busy and we had guests around. 
- 1 behavior I want to extinguish  
	- Sleep early. Don't slack off.

## V. Forecast 🔮  
> *What’s coming? What needs to be true by month-end?*

- Key focus areas for next month  
	- math grind for CMI (and pleasure)
	- getting upto speed with phy/chem via Ultralearning
	- new routine and experimentation to accomodate grind.
- One scary thing I’ll face  
	- Attempting an IOQM paper...
- 1–3 bold bets I’m placing
	- I will get a 2 digit mark on an IOQM paper
	- Become Ultralearning god. ASSIMILATE it.
	- I will finish making the Anki-Python project. 
- Risks / traps to avoid  
	- avoid burning out
	- go to school 2x a week to maintain complacency and live guilt-free.
	- don't depend on your "mood", or else you'd get fucked. discipline is key.
- If I only did ONE thing next month, it should be:
	- math grind.

## VI. System Check 🔧  
> *Are my tools, habits, and loops still fit for war?*

- What needs upgrading? (e.g. Anki deck, Obsidian, workflow)  
	- the whole daily / weekly routine.
		- imma need to wake up early, find time to grind.
		- be more systematic towards things.
		- do only the most IMPORTANT things.
	- my studying workflow
		- so far, i have been learning things from visuals and lessons from Chad, etc.
		- but now, it's time ultralearn this thing.
		- I will focus mostly on testing, not on making flowery obsidian notes, or studying too much from passive lessons.
		- I'll grind more on problems than on learning theory.
		- **I will optimise for maximum knowledge gained over least amount of time.**
	- my *pursuing* workflow?
		- i have been pursuing anything and everything for the last how many months.
		- but it is time to become the essentialist polymath instead.
		- i *can't* do it all. but i can do them one by one, provided they have good ROI.
		- 3x mornings and one saturday COMPLETELY dedicated for that.
- Am I reviewing the right things at the right intervals?  
	- I need to ankify these goals as well, to remember what i stand for and what is necessary.
- What habits are decaying? 
	- I think socialising has been down for a while.
- What routines need pruning or revamping?
	- oh the sleep routine needs a big fucking revamp.
	- reviewing and consolidating routine?
	- I need to improve my video editing routine; make it faster.

## VII. Notes to Future Me 💌  
> *Write a short note to the version of you reading this next month.*

Hey, big guy. I am expecting a lot for you. You may have not wanted that, but we both know that you really do. ==If you feel that you're struggling, know that that is exactly what you were setting out to do.==

You're doing great. Never settle now. Keep on doing what you are doing.

How much nagging will you take? How much longer will you wait to go beyond your comfort zone and not seek challenges? How much will you let the others control *you*? 

This repo is where I learn, reflect, win and fail. I will log as much as I can, showing you my journey of becoming an Übermensch and making sure that you'll get something from it. This is the HQ for the war I have declared **against mediocrity, comfort and tradition**.

The central idea of this war is the [Übermensch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdNpNGqi0Ks): the one who crosses the proverbial bridge. My aim is to transcend beyond the norm, the commonplace and venture onto the forbidden. 

It's time to get things in your control and become inevitable. Borrowing from Cal Newport: become so good they can't ignore you.
## Who am I and why am I doing this?
I am a senior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and **create** good stuff. 

And I am tired of being stuck in my comfort zone with my nagging parent in this cesspool of a system. This is really not something I want.

- When I should've been learning, I am finishing mundane assignments.
- When I should've been building something good, I am compelled not to by my own laziness.
- When I should've been chasing mastery, I am chasing attendance in school.
- **When I should've been transcending, I am stopped by the system.**

But I am different: I am cannot be put in one box. I am sure as hell *not* going to be conformed by this hell. 

And this is the way it's going to go: **I am going to escape the system by beating the system.** I am going to become **inevitable** and make **my own life** and cherish it with all my heart.

And so, I have declared a **war of becoming**. 
### The mission: becoming an [Übermensch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdNpNGqi0Ks), escaping academic hell, creating something better.

#### How?
- **Academics**: using Progressive Overload, efficient study techniques and deep work.
- **Physical**: letting go of comfort, physical exercise as a part of identity.
- **Mental**: seeking equanimity and accepting everything as *your* responsibility.
- **Spiritual**: Loving fate (*amor fati*), embracing joy.

And so much more. The Last Destination: *becoming* out of your own league.
#### But!
- This is not going to be easy.
- This needs extreme focus.
- This takes time.
- This requires you to **let go**. No more bullshitting.
## The 7 Commandments of this War 
I review these to remind myself what I stand for.

1. **I do deep, meaningful work. I do not fuck around.**  
2. **I am a problem-solving machine. I never settle.**  
3. **Comfort is the enemy. I live with deliberate intensity.**  
4. **I am a polymathic beast. I win across domains.**  
5. **I am not here to study. I am here to _transform_.**  
6. **I am ruthlessly focused. Calm, sharp, unshakeable.**  
7. **I am done being mid. I am inevitable.**

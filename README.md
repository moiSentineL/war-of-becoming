# War against mediocrity
This is the HQ for the war against mediocrity, comfort and tradition. How much nagging will you take? How much longer will you wait to go beyond your comfort zone? How much will you let the others control *you*? 

This repo is where I learn, reflect, win and fail. I will log as much as I can, showing you my journey and making sure that you'll get something from it. This might just be the place where YOU will find yourself. 

It's time to get things in your control and become inevitable. Borrowing from Cal Newport: become so good they can't ignore you.
## Who am I and why am I doing this?
I am a senior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and **create** good stuff. 

And I am tired of being stuck in my comfort zone with my nagging parent in this cesspool of a system. This is really not something I want.

- When I should've been learning, I am finishing mundane assignments.
- When I should've been chasing mastery, I am chasing attendance in school.
- **When I should've been transcending, I am stopped by the system.**

But I am different: I am cannot be put in one box. I am not going to be conformed by this hell. And this is the way it's going to go: **I am going to escape the system by beating the system.** I am going to become **inevitable**. And so, I have declared a **war on mediocrity**.

See the evergreen [page](https:nibirsan.org/war) related to this topic on my website.
### The mission: becoming an Übermensch, escaping academic hell, creating something better.

#### How?
- **Academics**: using Progressive Overload, efficient study techniques and deep work.
- **Physical**: letting go of comfort, physical exercise as a part of identity.
- **Mental**: seeking equanimity and accepting everything as *your* responsibility.

And so much more. The main motive is to become sharper and eventually escape the matrix.
#### But!
- This is not going to be easy.
- This needs extreme focus.
- This takes time.
- This requires you to **let go**. No more bullshitting.
## The 7 Commandments of this War 
I review these 7 Commandments daily to remind myself what I stand for.

1. **I do deep, meaningful work. I do not fuck around.**  
    This life is too short for mediocrity or bullshit.
2. **I am a problem-solving machine. I never settle.**  
    If it breaks, I fix it. If I fail, I learn. If I win, I raise the bar.
3. **Comfort is the enemy. I live with deliberate intensity.**  
    Pain is data. Struggle is the test. I choose the hard path—on purpose.
4. **I am a polymathic beast. I win across domains.**  
    I don’t fit in one box. I study everything, connect dots, and build systems.
5. **I am not here to study. I am here to _transform_.**  
    This is about mastery, not marks. Becoming, not conforming.
6. **I am ruthlessly focused. Calm, sharp, unshakeable.**  
    Equanimity under chaos. Laser-beam mind. Relentless improvement.
7. **I am done being mid. I am inevitable.**  
    No more playing small. I am building a future that rewrites the rules.

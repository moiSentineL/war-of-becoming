## Building a better self in public.
This is what this is all about.

Check the [website](https://nibirsan.org/war-of-becoming/) for more info.

### Note: this project is now archived and read-only. 

*(September 09, 2025)*

I evolved. And I realised that this website/war/ritual doesn't help me as much as I thought it would.

Things that had the biggest impact are logging daily wins and the 7 commandments. Others? Not so much. So I have shifted the daily wins to a [public Telegram Channel](https://t.me/nibirwins) and archived this project. 

## What's in this repo?
This is the *barracks* of this war. This is where everything happens.
### Structure:
Only if you're viewing this on GitHub lol.

```

```

There might also be something useful in the [assets](https://github.com/moiSentineL/war-of-becoming/tree/main/assets) folder as well.

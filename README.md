# War HQ
## Who am I and why am I doing this?
I am a senior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and **create** good stuff. 

And I am tired of being stuck in my comfort zone, not being able to proceed academically in this cesspool of an education system, pathetic Indian tradition and parents who want a 100% in everything. 

- When I should've been learning, I am chasing attendance in school.
- When I should've been building, I am getting nagged by my parents.
- **When I should've been transcending, I am stopped by the system.**

But I am different: I am cannot be put in one box. I am not going to be conformed by this hell. This is the way it's going to go: **I am going to escape the system by beating the system.** I am going to become **inevitable**. 

I have declared a **war on mediocrity**.
### The mission: becoming an Übermensch, escaping academic hell, creating something better.
## What's in this repo?
This is the *barracks* of this war. This is where everything happens. This is where I learn, reflect, win and fail. This is where YOU will find yourself.

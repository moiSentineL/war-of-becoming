## V. Forecast 🔮  
> *What’s coming? What needs to be true by month-end?*

- Key focus areas for next month  
	- Developing problem-solving intuition and tackling difficult problems; math journalling
	- finish IMT, for fucks sake.
	- digging through syllabus
- One scary thing I’ll face  
	- [speedrunning IP in 2 days](https://fatebook.io/q/will-i-be-able-to-speedrun-12th-ip--cm974hz3x0000tga14kr6ptjt)
- 1–3 bold bets I’m placing  
	- [I can finish the IMT within May.](https://fatebook.io/q/will-finish-the-imt-within-may?--cma56domu0003l1zrz4fdl1qy) -> 78%
	- [I can finish part 1 of the Math Book within May](https://fatebook.io/q/can-i-finish-part-1-of-the-math-book-within-may?--cma56f2vy00014vp50p0mmdpp) -> 57%
	- [I will post >=2 short, mostly raw videos on YT by the end of May](https://fatebook.io/q/will-post->=2-short,-mostly-raw-videos-on-yt-by-the-end-of-may?--cma57f5yt000h4vp5vhxnp84h) -> 60%
- Risks / traps to avoid  
	- Don't get trapped in [[Planning Fallacy]]. Don't pick too many things.
	- Please prioritise your fucking stuff.
	- always "hell yes, or nah" never in the middle.
- If I only did ONE thing next month, it should be:
	- math, math and MATH.
## VI. System Check 🔧  
> *Are my tools, habits, and loops still fit for war?*

- What needs upgrading? (e.g. Anki deck, Obsidian, workflow) 
	- Obsidian workflow to make the math journal.
	- Anki deck / evergreen page to keep track of my beliefs.
	- I need my desk setup and workflow to be more minimal. I hope that will be solved when my thinkpad comes around.
	- I should add more memories in my anki
	- also, read the fucking articles. ????
	- I need to fix my post-dinner and pre-lunch routine.
		- reading in the latter
		- and disconnecting in the first.
- Am I reviewing the right things at the right intervals?  
	- Probably not my beliefs. I need to do them more
- What habits are decaying?  
	- my reading habits, damn.
	- my spending-time-with-my-friends habits. I miss them. 
	- my writing habits, wow.
- What routines need pruning or revamping?
	- not now, i think.
	- oh yeah, i gotta fix my routines with gf. they must be non-negotiable.

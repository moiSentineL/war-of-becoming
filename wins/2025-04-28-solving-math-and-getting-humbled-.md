### 🔥 What I Did
I tried solving some IOQM-type questions and got humbled. 
Before that, I digged through G. Polya's "How to Solve It" Part II, the dialogue on how do to solve a problem. Pretty neat!

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- I am doing the progressive overload thing, right? So it matters that I am trying to up my game by attuning with some heavier problems.
- I am trying to incorporate the things I learn from Polya.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- You need to be humbled. Shit's not easy.
- Learning to solve problem is a procedure. It is iterations. 
- It all comes with practice: the idea is to develop a deadly arsenal of methods and intuitions.

### 🪓 Next Step
- do some more trying and failing but eventually succeeding.
- use the lesson's learned from Polya.

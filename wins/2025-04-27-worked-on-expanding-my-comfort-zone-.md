### 🔥 What I Did
Exactly: I started solving rapid fire physics questions with my friend Satvik. It was super fucking uneasy. I felt so fucking dumb. But I felt myself growing.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- I got an idea of how I can do some progressive overload.
- I got less insecure by the end. 
- I learned so many fucking things and removed some of my doubts.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- I need to up my game if I gotta survive.
- You need smart friends to hangout with (like Satvik).
- You need to be a tad bit more confident about yourself.

### 🪓 Next Step
- Improve math intuition and solve some nice questions
- Note down what you learned on Obsidian.

### 🔥 What I Did
- made a 3 min [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVQA3eb9eUw) under three hours (everything included).

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- i started my journey to become less of a perfectionist.
- this video was for me.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- color grading in Kdenlive (i used to edit on Premiere Pro before, but worked with Kdenlive heavily for the first time)
- how to streamline video content posting workflow:
    - hit record (with obs, that shit works.)
    - edit audio with Reaper (easy way) and import to Kdenlive
    - apply already made templates for LUT.
    - get frames from the video for thumbnail.
    - import the thumbnail into canva and add some blur and over that, some text.
    - ask ChatGPT to write a description.
    - use any of [these](https://fmhy.net/videopiracyguide#subtitle-tools) tools to transcribe subtitles.
    - post!

### 🪓 Next Step
- make the war repo public!

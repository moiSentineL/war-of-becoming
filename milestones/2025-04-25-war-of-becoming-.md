### 🧭 Description
I have finally declared a war against mediocrity, comfort and tradition. I make the rules now. I will remake myself and become the best version of myself. My journey starts now. I have a public repo on GitHub in which I will update everything related to the War there. This note should also be posted there.

No more bullshiting. Time to grind.

### 🚀 What Led to It

- Not being able to progress (mostly academically, but also from a "life" POV)
- Nagging from Parents (I know, it's the worst)
- Flawed system and the feeling of being stuck in a Catch-22.
- Knowing you can make your own rules and enlighten yourself once you really _choose to do so_.

---

### 🧩 What Changed

- New repo (this one), where I will track the war.
- New system of tracking, reflecting and adjusting (Obsidian-based)
- More clarity and confidence. I have now a reason to wake up early.
- Getting to understand my own limits have a sort of _humbling_ effect.

### 🛣️ Next Steps

Work on the War, keep updating the repo, start tracking shit and come back later to review.

## The 7 Commandments
1. **I do deep, meaningful work. I do not fuck around.**  
    This life is too short for mediocrity or bullshit.
2. **I am a problem-solving machine. I never settle.**  
    If it breaks, I fix it. If I fail, I learn. If I win, I raise the bar.
3. **Comfort is the enemy. I live with deliberate intensity.**  
    Pain is data. Struggle is the test. I choose the hard path—on purpose.
4. **I am a polymathic beast. I win across domains.**  
    I don’t fit in one box. I study everything, connect dots, and build systems.
5. **I am not here to study. I am here to _transform_.**  
    This is about mastery, not marks. Becoming, not conforming.
6. **I am ruthlessly focused. Calm, sharp, unshakeable.**  
    Equanimity under chaos. Laser-beam mind. Relentless improvement.
7. **I am done being mid. I am inevitable.**  
    No more playing small. I am building a future that rewrites the rules.

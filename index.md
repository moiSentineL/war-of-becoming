This website is dedicated to building a better person in public. This is where I learn, reflect, win and fail. I will log as much as I can, showing you my journey of becoming someone better. This is the HQ for the war I have declared **against mediocrity, comfort and tradition**.

The central idea of this war is the [Übermensch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdNpNGqi0Ks): the one who crosses the proverbial bridge. My aim is to transcend beyond the norm, the commonplace and venture onto the forbidden. 

It's time to get things in your control and become inevitable. Borrowing from Cal Newport: become so good they can't ignore you.
# Who am I and how did this happen?
I am a senior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and **create** good stuff. 

And I was tired of being stuck in my comfort zone, lazy and derelict in this cesspool of a system. This was really not something I wanted.

- When I should've been learning, I am finishing mundane assignments.
- When I should've been building something good, I am compelled not to by my own laziness.
- When I should've been chasing mastery, I am chasing attendance in school.
- **When I should've been transcending, I am stopped by the system.**

I asked myself: How much nagging will you take? How much longer will you wait to go beyond your comfort zone and seek challenges? How much will you let the others control *you*? 

So I decided that I had to become a comfortable with being uncomfortable, learn and do what's important and **escape the system by beating the system in its own game.**

I am going to become **inevitable** and make **my own life** and cherish it with all my heart. And so, I have declared a **war of becoming**. 
## The mission: becoming an [Übermensch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdNpNGqi0Ks), escaping academic hell, creating something better.

### How?
- **Academics**: using Progressive Overload, efficient study techniques and deep work.
- **Physical**: letting go of comfort, physical exercise as a part of identity.
- **Mental**: seeking equanimity and accepting everything as *your* responsibility.
- **Spiritual**: Loving fate (*amor fati*), embracing joy.

And so much more. The Last Destination: *becoming* out of your own league.
### But!
- This is not going to be easy. I will suffer.
- This needs extreme focus.
- This takes time.
- This requires you to **let go**. No more bullshitting.

## The 7 Commandments of this War 
I review these to remind myself what I stand for.

1. **I do deep, meaningful work. I do not fuck around.**  
2. **I am a problem-solving machine. I never settle.**  
3. **Comfort is the enemy. I live with deliberate intensity.**  
4. **I am a polymathic beast. I win across domains.**  
5. **I am not here to study. I am here to _transform_.**  
6. **I am ruthlessly focused. Calm, sharp, unshakeable.**  
7. **I am done being mid. I am inevitable.** 

See the [commandments](/war-of-becoming/commandments/) as whole.

## milestones
Most important achievements in this war.
- **2025-04-25** - Declared this War.

## project
Current Projects:
- [Project Math Machine](https://github.com/moiSentineL/war-of-becoming/blob/main/projects/project-math-machine.md): git gud at math and be able to solve some actual stuff.

## wall of failure
I learn from failure. And I transform.
- **2025-05-02** - I did not get into [RSI-India](https://www.cee.org/RSI_India). I did not have enough credentials to get through. I am not inevitable yet. 

## goals and forecasts
Ideal Expectations that I want to achieve.
### 6 Months
1. I'd be able to solve (easy-medium) Olympiad Level math problems
2. I'd be calmer, sharper and more focused.
3. I'll have a wide arsenal of mental model and heuristics which come in handy everywhere.
4. I will be more fit, get some gains and probably max out my current workout program.
5. I'd be more comfortable with being uncomfortable.
6. I'd be less of an imperfectionist
7. I'd have finished my 12th Grade syllabus and say a big "Fuck You!" to CBSE
8. I'd be much better at managing my schedule, not slacking off and optimising tings according to priorities.
9. I'd rest better and more healthily.
10. I'd have quitted porn forever.
11. I'd have gained some cooking skills, enough for survival.
12. I'd be starting the level 3 of [my philosophy curricula](/phil/).
13. I'd be a much better person and a much better thinker.
